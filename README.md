## Message from the instructor

Hi! I'm glad that you're investing in yourself to learn these advanced topics for Bitbucket Pipelines.

I'm a firm believer in the power of hands-on learning so the exercise files are packed with demos and challenges that you can use to follow along.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running the demos and challenges _will_ use up quite a few build minutes. If you're using a free account, I highly encourage you to invest in Overage Protection that will add minutes as needed if you go over the 50 minutes per month limit.
>
> You can find more information on the Overage Protection here: [Manage your plan and billing](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-your-plan-and-billing/)

I had a great time putting this course together and I hope you enjoy it just as much.

Cheers!
