# 02_01 Getting to Know Pipes

Bitbucket Pipeline pipes are pre-packaged commands that simplify complex CI/CD tasks. They encapsulate intricate operations into portable configuration elements that you can easily reuse across different workspaces, projects, and repositories.

Key points include:

- **Pre-packaged & Reusable:** Pipes bundle all necessary code in lightweight Docker containers, allowing you to execute complex commands with minimal setup.
- **Parameterization:** You can customize pipes by passing repository or pipeline variables, tailoring them to the specific needs of your workflow.
- **Wide Integration:** Bitbucket provides dozens of pre-built pipes that integrate with popular cloud platforms, collaboration tools, and third-party services.
- **In-Context Feedback:** Many pipes can output reports directly within the Bitbucket interface, helping developers stay focused and iterate rapidly.

This unit will demonstrate practical examples of using pipes, showing just how easy it is to integrate these powerful tools into your CI/CD pipelines.
