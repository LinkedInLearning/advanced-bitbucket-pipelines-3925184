# 02_02 Use a pipe in a pipeline configuration

## Using the exercise files for this lesson

1. Create a new repo and add the exercise files
1. Review the CloudFormation template: [AWS-Lambda-CloudFormation.yml](./AWS-Lambda-CloudFormation.yml)
1. Review the contents of the pipeline configuration: [bitbucket-pipelines.yml](./bitbucket-pipelines.yml)
1. Run the pipeline
1. review the output of the step that calls the pipe for the [Bitbucket Security: Infrastructure as Code Security Scanner](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bitbucket-iac-scan/src/master/)
1. Review the report generated by the pipeline run

## Shenanigans

Approved pipes are sourced from container registries hosted by Bitbucket.

> [!Important]
> But because pipes are essentially container images, we can run any publicly available container as a pipe!

Review the contents of this [pipeline configuration](./Shenanigans/bitbucket-pipelines.yml) to see how`hello-world` images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and the [Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/) are used as pipes in a pipeline.

For extra credit, run the pipeline to see the results!
