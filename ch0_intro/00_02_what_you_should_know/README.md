# 00_02 What You Should Know

To get the most out of this course, there are a few things you should be familiar with.  You should also know that this course has built in features to help you out along the way.

## Git and Bitbucket

You should already be familiar with using the following tools:

- **Git**, a free, open-source version control system that allows users to store code, track changes, and collaborate on projects
- **Bitbucket**, a cloud-based service for hosting git repositories.

You should already know how to create the following using Bitbucket:

- Workspaces
- Projects
- Repositories
- Branches
- Pull Requests
- Pipelines

This course will share some basics and reviews along the way but if you’re unfamiliar with Git or Bitbucket, you can use the following LinkedIn Learning courses to get up to speed or as references.
