# 00_03 Using the Exercise Files

To help you get the most out of this course, exercise files are available for you to use.  You can refer to these files to follow along and as a starting point for challenges.

The exercise files are located in the  following GitHub repository:

- [Advanced Bitbucket Pipelines: Automating Deployments & Managing Third Party Integrations](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/advanced-bitbucket-pipelines-automating-deployments-and-managing-third-party-integrations-3925184.git)

## Downloading the Exercise Files

The best way to use the exercise files is to download the contents as a zip file and extract the archive to your local system.

The contents are organized by chapter and video.
