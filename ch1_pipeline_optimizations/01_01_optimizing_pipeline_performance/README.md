# 01_01 Optimizing Pipeline Performance and Reducing Build Times

In this chapter, we’ll cover four strategies for optimizing pipelines:

1. **Configuring Maximum Runtime:** Setting sensible time limits to prevent unnecessary resource usage.
1. **Configuring Runner Sizes:** Choosing the right runner size for your build to balance speed and cost.
1. **Using Conditional Statements in Pipelines:** Making your pipelines smarter by running only the necessary steps.
1. **Caching Dependencies:** Leveraging caches to avoid re-downloading or re-building dependencies every time your pipeline runs.

Each of these strategies can significantly improve your pipeline performance and contribute to faster, more efficient development cycles. Let’s get started and dive into the first topic: **Configuring Maximum Runtime**.
