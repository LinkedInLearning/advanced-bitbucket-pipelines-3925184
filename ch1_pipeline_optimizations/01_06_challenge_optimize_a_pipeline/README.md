# 01_06 Challenge: Optimize a Workflow in Bitbucket Pipelines

### Scenario for the DevOps Professional:

#### Scenario: Optimizing the Data Analysis Workflow in Bitbucket Pipelines

The Data Analysis team at your organization has developed a Python script for clustering analysis and report generation. This script processes a large dataset stored in a JSON file and generates an analysis report. It needs to run as part of a CI workflow in **Bitbucket Pipelines**. The Data Analysis team is facing challenges with execution time and resource usage, and theyâ€™ve asked you, the DevOps engineer, to optimize their workflow.

Here are the specific requirements and challenges:

1. **Caching Dependencies:**
   Ensure that Python libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) are cached to avoid reinstallation during each pipeline run.

2. **Caching the Dataset:**
   The dataset is stored at `./data/dataset.json`. If the dataset exists, the script reuses it instead of regenerating it. The pipeline should cache this dataset to avoid redundant computations or re-creation.

3. **Time Limit:**
   The analysis process must not exceed **30 minutes**, ensuring efficient resource usage and adherence to pipeline timeout constraints.

4. **Pipeline Optimization Goals:**
   - Minimize the pipeline run time by leveraging caching mechanisms for both dependencies and the dataset.
   - Provide clear logs and artifacts for the Data Analysis team to review the clustering results.

#### Deliverables:

1. **Bitbucket Pipelines Configuration:**
   Write a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file that:
   - Sets up a Python environment.
   - Caches Python dependencies and the dataset.
   - Runs the analysis script.

2. **Monitoring and Time Constraints:**
   - Use Bitbucket Pipelines' built-in timeout settings to ensure the job fails gracefully if it exceeds 30 minutes.
   - Provide logs and the analysis report as downloadable artifacts.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document the caching mechanisms implemented and explain how they improve pipeline efficiency.
   - Include a step-by-step guide for the Data Analysis team to debug or update the workflow.
